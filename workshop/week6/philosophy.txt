Here are some questions for reflection...

1. What IS this thing, philosophy, anyway? What kind of thing is it -- a collection of theories? Questions? A state of mind? A form of intelligence? A process? What?

2. The word, "philosophy," is derived from two Greek roots: "philos" (love) and "sophia" (wisdom). Two questions: (a) Do you? (i.e., do you love wisdom? Or if "love" is too strong, do you care about it? Is it a value for you? That may take some soul searching.) And (b) What is wisdom? Experience? Knowledge? A way of processing experience? Or what?

3. The tree of philosophy has three main branches ... metaphysics, epistemology and axiology. What do these terms mean? (You might want to do a search at About.com ... or a more general Internet search using your favorite search engine.)

4. Relativism and absolutism are views about views. Relativism is the view that all views are equally valid ... that one view is just as good as another. Absolutism is the view that there is one correct view on an issue and the others are simply false. Where do you fall? Are you a relativist or an absolutist? What reasons could you give for adopting either position?

5. Skepticism is a form of absolutism. It claims that there is one correct view, but we cannot know what it is. There are two forms of skepticism -- universal and limited. A limited skeptic believes that we cannot know things within a certain limited range. A universal skeptic claims that we cannot know anything whatsoever. What's the obvious reply to universal skepticism?
